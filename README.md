## Project Overview
This project uses Jasmine to run a series of tests on a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Instructions
To view the feedreader website 

1. Download all the files
2. Load index.html in your browser.
3. You can also view the website [here](https://kt2187.github.io/project-4-feedreader/).

## Tests
Open the index.html file in your browser and the tests will run automatically. The included tests are as follows:

RSS Feeds:
* Feeds are defined.
* Feed URLs are defined.
* Feed names are defined.

The Menu:
* The menu is hidden by default.
* When clicked the menu changes visibility.

Initial Entries:
* Feed container has at least 1 entry.

New Feed Selection:
* Feed content changes when new feed is selected.

## Dependencies
Dependecies are included as links within the index.html file.

* Jasmine 2.1.2 testing framework
* jQuery 2.1.1
* Handlebars 2.0.0
* Fonts from Google: Roboto
* Normalize
* icomoon

## Browser Compatibilities
This application has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Acknowledgments
* Starter code was povided by Udacity.
* Matthew Cranford (incredible student who took the time to create another tutorial with step by step instructions and screenshots).

## Resources I referred to:
These resources and webinars were provided by Udacity mentors, coaches, student leaders, and students. This was my first experience writing test suites and I heavily relied on these resources.

## What I learned
* I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How this will help my career
* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
